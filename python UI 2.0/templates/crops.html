            <h2><a name="climate"></a> Climatic Requirements</h2>
            <p>Tomato is a warm season crop, it requires warm and
            cool climate. The plants cannot withstand frost and high humidity. Also
            light intensity affects pigmentation, fruit colour, fruit set. The plant
            is highly affected by adverse climatic conditions. It requires different
            climatic range for seed germination, seedling growth, flower and fruit
            set, and fruit quality. Temperature below 10<sup>0</sup>C and above 38<sup>0</sup>C
            adversely affects plant tissues thereby slow down physiological
            activities. It thrives well in temperature 10<sup>0</sup>C to 30<sup>0</sup>C
            with optimum range of temperature is 21-24<sup>0</sup>C. The mean
            temperature below 16<sup>0</sup>C and above 27<sup>0</sup>C are not
            desirable. The plant doesnâ€™t withstand frost, it requires low to
            medium rainfall, and does well under average monthly temperature of 21
            to 23<sup>0</sup>C. Avoid water stress and long dry period as it causes
            cracking of fruits. Bright sunshine at the time of fruit set helps to
            develop dark red coloured fruits.</p>

          <h2><a name="Soil Requirement"></a>Soil Requirement</h2>        
          <p>Tomatoes do very well on most mineral soils, but they
          prefer deep, well drained sandy loams. Upper layer of soil should be
          porous with little sand and good clay in the subsoil. Soil depth 15 to
          20cm proves to be good for healthy crop. Deep tillage can allow for
          adequate root penetration in heavy clay type soils, which allows for
          production in these soil types.<br /><br />Tomato is a moderately tolerant crop to a wide pH
          range. A pH of 5.5- 6.8 is preferred. Though tomato plants will do well
          in more acidic soils with adequate nutrient supply and availability.
          Tomato is moderately tolerant to acid an soil that is pH of 5.5. The
          soils with proper water holding capacity, aeration, free from salts are
          selected for cultivation.<br /><br />Soils extremely high in organic matter are not
          recommended due to the high moisture content of this media and nutrient
          deficiencies. But, as always, the addition of organic matter to mineral
          soils will increase yield.</p></div>
          <div class="row space-clear container-fluid">
          <h2><a name="Choice"></a>Choice of seeds</h2>
          <p>After seed production, diseased, broken seeds are
          discarded. The seeds for sowing should be free from inert matter. Early
          germinating, bold, uniform in shape and size, seeds are selected for
          sowing. Hybrid seeds from F1 generation are advantageous for sowing as
          it gives early and high yield uniform fruity, resistant to adverse
          environmental conditions.</font></p>
          <strong>a) Seed and sowing</strong>
          <p>Tomato is generally cultivated by transplanting
          seedlings on ridges and furrows. At the time of transplanting seedlings
          are harder by exposing to open weather or by withholding irrigation. A
          seed rate of 400 to 500g/ha is required.</p>
          <p>Seeds are treated with Thiram @ 3g/kg of seed to
          protect from seed born diseases. Seed treatment with B. naphthoxyacetic
          acid (BNOA) at 25 and 50 ppm, gibberllic acid (GA3) at 5-20 ppm and
          chlorophenoxy acetic at 10 and 20 ppm was found to improve the growth
          and yield of tomato.</p>
          <p>Seeds are sown in June July for autumn winter crop
          and for spring summer crop seeds are sown in November. In the hills seed
          is sown in March April. The spacing recommended for the autumn winter
          crop is 75 x 60cm and for spring summer crop 75 x 45cm.</p>

                     <p>The ideal seedbed should be 60cm wide, 5-6cm long and
          20-25cm high. Clods and stubbles should be removed from the seedbed. Add
          sieved FYM and fine sand on the seedbed. Bring them to fine tilth.
          Drench the bed with Fytolon/Dithane M-45 @ 2-2.5 g/lit of water. Draw
          the lines 10 to 15cm apart throughout the length of the seedbed. Sow the
          seeds thinly spaced in lines, press gently, cover with fine sand and
          then cover the bed with straw. Irrigate with rose can. Irrigate the
          seedbed twice a day till the seeds germinate. Remove the straw after the
          seeds germinate. Apply a little Thimet at 4-5 leaf stage. Spray the
          seedlings with Metasystox/Thiodan @ 2-2.5 ml/lit water and Dithane M-45
          @ 2-2.5 g/lit water.</p>

          <h2><a name="Fertilizers"></a>Fertilizers</h2>
          <p>As the fruit production and quality depends upon
          nutrient availability and fertilizer application so balance fertilizer
          are applied as per requirement. The nitrogen in adequate quantity
          increases fruit quality, fruit size, color and taste. It also helps in
          increasing desirable acidic flavor. Adequate amount of potassium is also
          required for growth, yield and quality. Mono Ammonium Phosphate (MAP)
          may be used as a starter fertilizer to supply adequate phosphorus during
          germination and seedling stages. Calcium availability is also very
          important to control soil pH and nutrient availability. Sandy soils will
          require a higher rate of fertilizer, and more frequent applications of
          these fertilizers due to increased leaching of essential nutrients. The
          seedlings are sprayed with starter solution of micronutrient. Before
          planting farm yard manure @ 50 ton per hectares should be incorporated.
          Normally tomato crop requires 120kg Nitrogen (N), 50kg Phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>),
          and 50kg Potash (K<sub>2</sub>O). Nitrogen should be given in split
          doses. Half nitrogen and full P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> is given at the
          time of transplanting and remaining nitrogen is given after 30 days and
          60 days of transplanting.</p>
          <p>Soil and tissue analyses should be taken throughout
          the growing and production season to insure essential nutrients are in
          their proper amounts and ratios. Tissue analysis of a nutritionally
          sufficient plant will show the following nutrient status:</p>

          <p>Tomatoes have been observed to withdraw water from
          depths up to 13 feet in a well structured soil. Tomato plants require
          adequate moisture throughout their growth period. First irrigation is
          required soon after seedlings are transplanted. Frequent water is
          necessary in root zone when plants are small. In summer irrigation at
          intervals of 3-4 days and 10-15 days water is necessary to maintain wet
          soil. Erratic moisture conditions can cause radial and concentric

    wide range of climatic conditions. However, it cannot stand too hot or too cold weather.
    It prefers moderate temperature in summer as well as in winter. Short days are very
    favourable for the formation of bulbs. It can be grown well at elevations of 1000 to 1300
    m above MSL. Garlic requires well drained loamy soils, rich in humus, with fairly good
    content of potash. The crop raised on sandy or loose soil does soils, the bulbs produced

    bulb. Bulbs with side growth should be discarded. Healthy cloves or bulbils free from
    disease and injuries should be used for sowing and about 150 to 200 kg cloves are required
    to plant one hectare. They are sown by dibbling or furrow planting. </font></p>

    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="sans serif, verdana, arial" size="2">Garlic is a crop of 4
    Â½ to 5 months duration. When the leaves start turning yellowish or brownish and show
    signs of drying up, the crop is ready for harvest. The plants are then pulled out or
    uprooted with a country plough and are tied into small bundles which are then kept in the
    field or in the shade or 2-3 days for curing and drying so that the bulbs become hard and
    their keeping quality is improved. The bulbs may be stored by hanging them on bamboo
    sticks or by keeping them on dry sand on the market, the dried stalks are removed and
    bulbs are cleaned. Well cured garlic bulbs can be kept for 1 to 1 Â½ months in an ordinary
    well ventilated room. If dust smoke is given to it, the bulbs can be stored for 8 to 10
    months. They can also be stored at 32<sup>0</sup>F with 60% R.H. Average yield level is 6
    to 8 t/ha.</font></p>
